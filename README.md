# Hi 👋, I'm Saifeddine Jaballah

I'm a computer science graduate with a passion for innovative technologies, particularly in the fields of Flutter, Java, and Augmented Reality (AR).

🔭 I'm currently working as a Project Lead Developer at INDAUTECH, where I'm developing industrial automation solutions, including a mobile app for real-time machine monitoring and control.

🌱 I'm currently studying at ESPRIT university.

👯 I'm eager to collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of mobile development and AR.
